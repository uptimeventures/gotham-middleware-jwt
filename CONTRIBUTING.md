## Source Code Platforms

While the source for this crate is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/uptimeventures/gotham-middleware-jwt), primary
development happens over on GitLab. This doesn't mean you shouldn't submit pull
requests to GitHub (as the team frequently checks both platforms), but it does
limit the types of PRs the core team accepts. For instance:

* **Don't** submit a PR specifying that one version of the repository is out of
    date, and to use the other. This prohibition includes standard
    documentation, but even more importantly, extends to package configuration
    files.

* **Do** reach out and ask us to update the GitHub mirror if appears to be out
    of date.

## Formatting

Format your code using [`rustfmt` `nightly`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). Additionally, you should consider using [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy).

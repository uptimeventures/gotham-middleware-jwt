## License

By submitting code, documentation, visual and/or multimedia assets to the project, you agree to license those contributions under project license terms, which can be found in the LICENSE document, at the root of the repository.

## Source Code Platforms

While the source of this crate is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/uptimeventures/gotham-middleware-jwt), most development occurs over on GitLab. The choice of platform is largely based on personal preference and subject to change, but this doesn't mean you shouldn't submit pull requests to GitHub (as the team frequently checks both platforms) if it works for you.

It does, however, affect types of contributions the project accepts. For instance:

**Don't** submit pull requests specifying that one version of the repository is out of date, and to use the other.

If a source code host becomes the preferred one, the core team will update and release as necessary. Until then, both code hosts are considered valid.

**Do** reach out and ask the team to update GitHub if the mirror appears to be out of date. (This happens occasionally!)

## Formatting

Format your code using [`rustfmt` `nightly`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). Additionally, you should consider using [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy).
